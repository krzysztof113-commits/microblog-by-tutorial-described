# microblog-by-tutorial-descripted
Based on @miguelgrinberg flask tutorial

I put many comments about how the application works, different versions, steps I made following the tutorial and understanding.
I am beginner of Python and Flask at the stage of working on this project so the comments I made can be not true or professional.
I should also say that my English grammar, orthography is not great either and the project is mainly created for me to understand the basics better, get back to them.
Thanks to everyone if you want to comment this piece of work or point to errors I could have made.
